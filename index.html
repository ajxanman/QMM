    <h3>What is a questumation mark?</h3>
    <p>A questumation mark is a form of punctuation for separating sarcastic sentences from serious ones! You simply add it at the end of a sentence just like a period, and people will know you're being sarcastic! For example: "Why don't we just use cooking oil instead of motor oil (questumation mark)".</p>
    <h3>What is the goal of the questumation mark movement?</h3>
    <p>Our goal is to make the questumation mark available on all keyboards! We feel that this would be a very usefull mark of punctuation that people would use on and everyday basis!</p>
    <h3>Why should it be incorporated in keyboards around the world?</h3>
    <p>It would be very usefull in many situations. When speaking, the tone of your voice shows how you mean what you're saying, but that can be very difficult when typing! With a questumation mark, you can more easily be sarcastic in texts, emails, and any other time you're using a keyboard!</p>
